Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client for this project was The Gaming Room. They ased to improve their game that was called "Draw It Or Lose It". To improve it, they wanted to make it available for users on multiple platforms as well as improve the efficiency and functionality of it. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I focused on the tasks and requirements given by the client. It helped me focus on things that were important and neccisary as well as making sure I satisfied the requirements. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I thought it was helpful that they recommended what I should do and where I should implement the code. It saved a lot of time as I did not have to play "where is waldo" and I could focus on development.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would focus on revising the form that was presented to the client. I saw that I did not fill it out correctly in some spots like the objective of the project and what the requirements were.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider the user because I had to make sure that it was to their standard. When I was making a decision, I chose the one that would increase user satisfaction. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the designing for the software with a clear image of what the requirements were. This is something that I would use in the future because it ensures I do what is needed and satisfy all the requirements. The most important thing is to develop a project that does what it is supposed to.
